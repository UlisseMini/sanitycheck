    <h1>The Future of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence will definitely solve all of humanity's problems by 2030.
            This is obvious because technology always improves exponentially, and AI is the
            ultimate technology. Therefore, we can conclude that unemployment, disease, and
            poverty will all be eliminated within the next few years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many experts agree that AI systems are becoming smarter every day. Since AI is
            improving, it follows that it will continue to improve forever. This means that
            eventually AI will surpass human intelligence in every domain. When this happens,
            all human work will become unnecessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some people worry about AI safety, but these concerns are overblown. After all,
            we've always been able to control our technology in the past. Cars, planes, and
            nuclear weapons have never caused any serious problems that we couldn't handle.
            Therefore, advanced AI systems will also be easy to control.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, the development of artificial general intelligence is inevitable
            and will unquestionably lead to a utopian future. Anyone who disagrees with this
            assessment is either ignorant of the facts or has ulterior motives. The science
            is settled, and we should move forward with AI development as quickly as possible
            without excessive regulation or caution.
