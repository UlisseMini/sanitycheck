Researchers followed 10,000 participants for 5 years and found that those who ate breakfast daily had 20% lower rates of heart disease. The study controlled for age, exercise, smoking, and socioeconomic status.

This confirms what nutritionists have long suspected: breakfast really is the most important meal of the day. The morning meal kickstarts your metabolism and provides essential nutrients that protect cardiovascular health.

If you're skipping breakfast to lose weight or save time, you're making a dangerous trade-off. The science is clear: eating breakfast is one of the simplest things you can do to protect your heart.
