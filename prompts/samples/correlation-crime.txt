A new study found that neighborhoods with more police presence had higher crime rates. The researchers analyzed data from 50 major cities and found a strong positive correlation (r=0.72) between police officers per capita and violent crime rates.

This demonstrates that increasing police presence actually causes more crime, not less. The mechanism is clear: police presence criminalizes normal behavior, creates adversarial relationships with communities, and leads to a cycle of escalating conflict.

Cities should therefore reduce police budgets and redirect those funds to social services. The data is unambiguous—more police means more crime.
