Our company switched to remote work during the pandemic and saw a 15% increase in output per employee. Employees reported higher satisfaction, and we saved $2 million annually on office space. This proves that remote work is simply better for productivity.

Some managers worry about collaboration, but our Slack messages increased by 200%, showing that communication actually improved. We also hired people from 12 new states, dramatically expanding our talent pool.

The return-to-office movement is driven by managers who want to justify their existence through visibility rather than results. Companies that force employees back are making an emotional decision, not a rational one based on the evidence.
