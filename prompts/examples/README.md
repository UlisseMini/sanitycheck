# Metacognitive Strategy Examples

This directory contains annotated examples for each metacognitive strategy. Each file should have ~10 examples showing how to identify specific types of logical fallacies.

## Files

- **optionA-inversion-examples.md** - Examples of inverting "X because Y" to find unjustified principles
- **optionB-hidden-premise-examples.md** - Examples of extracting hidden universal premises
- **optionC-does-it-follow-examples.md** - Examples of questioning property correlations
- **optionD-modus-ponens-examples.md** - Examples of reconstructing implicit syllogisms
- **optionE-steelman-negation-examples.md** - Examples of steelmanning the opposite view
- **optionF-property-linking-examples.md** - Examples of flagging unjustified property links

## How to Use

1. Add ~10 examples to each file following the template provided
2. Focus on diverse types of logical errors:
   - Correlation/causation confusion
   - Property linking without justification
   - Unstated assumptions
   - Overgeneralizations
   - False dichotomies
   - Statistical claims without evidence
   - Anecdotal evidence as universal proof

3. For each example, include:
   - The problematic passage
   - The logical structure of the error
   - Why it's problematic
   - How to spot similar errors

## Integration

Once filled, these examples will be automatically loaded into the Stage 1 prompt to help the model better identify logical fallacies.
